# Example

Below is an example of a platform definition using `v1alpha1` of The Platform Specification, for a very simple AWS based platform.

> [!WARNING]
> This example is not yet complete.  The specification is still a work in process and is being actively designed.

> [!NOTE] REMEMBER
> This is a **SPECIFICATION**.
> It is a way of describing a platform.
> It is _not_ a system responsible for the implementation of said platform; that is left to the function of Blueprints.
> 
> See [Workflow and Usage](workflow-and-usage) for further details.
