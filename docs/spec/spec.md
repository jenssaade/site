# The Specification
## Introduction
The Platform Specification defines a structured, declarative framework for describing and managing cloud-native platforms. It is designed to standardize how platforms are represented, making it easier for teams to define, build, and operate consistent, scalable, and secure platforms across diverse environments. By capturing the essential components, configurations, and policies of a platform in a clear and organized format, the specification serves as the foundation for both human and automated processes in platform engineering.

The specification uses a YAML or JSON structure modeled on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), ensuring compatibility with cloud-native ecosystems. Each instance of the specification includes well-defined fields and sections that describe the platform's infrastructure, services, policies, and operational guidelines. This approach allows platform teams to capture the desired state of their platform while maintaining flexibility in implementation and tooling.

While the Platform Specification is modeled on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to leverage a familiar, structured, and extensible format, it is not tied to Kubernetes clusters or their runtime environments. The specification is simply a declarative framework written in YAML or JSON, intended to be stored in files and parsed by any program or tool that supports these formats. There is no requirement to leverage or install the objects into a Kubernetes cluster. Instead, the specification serves as a standalone document that can be used to define platform requirements, generate configurations, or drive orchestration workflows across any infrastructure or tooling ecosystem. This decoupled design ensures maximum flexibility and accessibility for diverse use cases and environments.

> [!WARNING]
> The specification is still a work in process and is being actively designed.
>
> Expect active/frequent changes.
>
> Modifications to the spec will be highlighted on the [news](../../news) page accordingly.

## Document Structure
The Platform Specification has embraced a modern approach to defining and managing your platforms using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This allows us to leverage the power and flexibility of Kubernetes while providing a structured and declarative way to represent platform components.

The Platform Specification defines several core CRD types, each representing a distinct element within your platform:

![PlatformSpecMindMap (light)](./PlatformSpecMindMap-light.drawio.png){.light-only}
![PlatformSpecMindMap (dark)](./PlatformSpecMindMap-dark.drawio.png){.dark-only}

Each api kind represents a fundamental aspect of the platform:

  * **Platform:** Represents the overarching blueprint for your entire platform. It encompasses high-level configurations, policies, and references to other resources like credentials, providers, and environments, and more.
  * **Credential:** Defines reference parameters for locations to sensitive information required for connecting to various services (e.g., API keys, passwords) and interacting with Providers.
  * **Provider:** Defines the specific provider or service used for managing parts of your Platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Each provider configuration includes details about any specific settings required for that provider.
  * **Environment:** Represents a distinct operational environment for your platform (e.g., development, testing, production). Environments often have unique configurations, resource constraints, or access policies.
  * **Cluster:** Defines a cluster within your platform. Clusters can be of many orchestration engines, from Kubernetes to Fargate to Nomad, or more.  This includes details about the cluster's size, network configuration, node types, and other relevant settings.
  * **Server:** Specifies individual servers or virtual machines deployed within your platform. Servers are associated with specific environments, providers, and software configurations.
  * **SoftwareGroup:** Represents a collection of software packages to be installed into your cluster(s) or server(s). Software Groups define installation methods, dependencies, and configuration settings for these packages.
  * **Image:** Defines machine or container images used within your platform, often associated with Clusters and Servers.
  * **SoftwarePackage:** Represents a single software package to be installed as part of a SoftwareGroup. It includes details about the package name, version, source repository, dependencies, and installation instructions.
  * **Policy:** Defines rules and constraints that apply to various aspects of your platform, such as resource usage, security configurations, or deployment workflows. Policies can enforce best practices, ensure compliance with regulations, or automate specific actions based on predefined conditions.

The Platform Specification structure promotes a modular and organized approach to defining complex cloud platforms, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and consistency across different environments and deployments.

Letâ€™s walk through these API Kinds:

### Clusters
The `clusters` section of the Platform Specification defines the compute environments used for deploying and managing applications within the platform. This includes Kubernetes clusters, serverless deployments (like AWS Fargate), container orchestration systems like Nomad, and potentially other future technologies. Each cluster entry represents a distinct deployment environment with its own configuration parameters.

**Structure:**

```

  **Nomad-Specific Config:**

::: code-group
```yaml [platform.yaml]
# Example Nomad config
config:
  clientAddress: "#/providers/network/private-ip-address"
  datacenter: "main"
  jobTemplate: "#/jobs/my-nomad-job"
```

**Usage Notes:**

* The `clusters` section provides a flexible way to define and manage diverse compute environments across various platforms.

### Servers
The `servers` section of the Platform Specification defines individual virtual servers (instances) that exist within various environments and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers.  These are standalone servers, distinct from server groups or clusters. Each server entry represents a specific instance with its own configuration details.

**Structure:**

```
servers:
  <server-name>: 
    type: <string>   # "ec2", "azureVM", "gceInstance", etc. 
    iaasProvider: <string> # Reference to provider configuration (e.g., "#/providers/iaas/aws")
    environment: <string>  # Reference to the environment where the server resides
    region: <string>      # Geographic region for the server
    network: <string>    # Network configuration identifier (e.g., VPC name)
    config:
      <configuration-key>: <value> # Additional server-specific settings 
```

**Fields:**

* **`<server-name>`**: A unique identifier for the server instance (e.g., `dev-server-aws`).
* **`type`**: Specifies the type of virtual machine technology being used:
    * "ec2": Amazon EC2 instances
    * "azureVM": Azure Virtual Machines
    * "gceInstance": Google Compute Engine Instances
    * (**Future expansion**) Other IaaS provider instance types
* **`iaasProvider`**:  Reference to the provider configuration responsible for managing the server. This usually points to a section in your YAML that defines specific settings for the IaaS provider (e.g., `#/providers/iaas/aws`).
* **`environment`**:  Reference to the environment where the server will be deployed (e.g., `#/environments/development`). 
* **`region`**: The geographic region where the server's infrastructure will reside.
* **`network`**: An identifier referencing the network configuration used by the server, such as a VPC name or subnet ID.

* **`config`**: A nested dictionary containing additional server-specific configurations:



::: code-group
```yaml [platform.yaml]
# Example Server Config
config:
  size: "t3.medium" # Instance size (e.g., EC2 instance type)
  machineImage: "#/images/machine/custom-aws-image"
  # ... other server-specific settings 
```

```json [platform.json]
{
  "config": {
    "size": "t3.medium",
    "machineImage": "#/images/machine/custom-aws-image"
  }
}
```
:::

**Usage Notes:**

* The `servers` section allows for the definition of individual servers across different cloud providers and environments, enabling a modular and scalable approach to infrastructure management.





### Software

The `software` section of the Platform Specification defines collections or groups of software to be deployed across your clusters and servers.  These groups encapsulate the necessary configurations and instructions for installing, managing, and updating software components within your platform.


**Structure:**

```
software:
  groups:
    <group-name>: 
      packages:
        - name: <package-name>
          type: <installation-mechanism> # "helm", "ansible", "docker", etc. 
          # ... Configuration specific to the installation type
```

**Fields:**

* **`groups`**: A dictionary containing groups of software packages:

    * **`<group-name>`**:  A descriptive name for the software group (e.g., `general`, `database`, `frontend`).
     * **`packages`**: An array of individual software package definitions within the group:
      * **`name`**: A unique identifier for the software package (e.g., `nginx-web-server`). 
      * **`type`**: The method used to install and manage this package:
        * `"helm"`:  Installation using Helm charts.
        * `"ansible"`: Deployment using Ansible playbooks.
        * `"docker"`: Containerized deployment using Docker images.
         **(Future expansion)** Other software installation mechanisms.

**Example:**

::: code-group
```yaml [platform.yaml]
software:
  groups:
    general:
      packages:
        - name: nginx-web-server
          type: helm
          helm:
            chart: stable/nginx
            version: "1.16.1"
            values:
              replicaCount: 2
              service:
                type: LoadBalancer
            namespaces:
              - web-namespace
```

```json [platform.json]
{
  "software": {
    "groups": {
      "general": {
        "packages": [
          {
            "name": "nginx-web-server",
            "type": "helm",
            "helm": {
              "chart": "stable/nginx",
              "version": "1.16.1",
              "values": {
                "replicaCount": 2,
                "service": {
                  "type": "LoadBalancer"
                }
              },
              "namespaces": [
                "web-namespace"
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
:::

 **Usage Notes:**

* The `software` section allows you to define reusable software configurations for deployment across multiple environments. 
* By separating installation methods (`type`) and specific configuration settings, you can create modular and adaptable software deployments.




### Policies
The Policies section governs the operational and cost-management aspects of the platform. Policies may include logging, scaling, backups, or disaster recovery strategies. This ensures that critical governance and operational practices are well defined and consistently applied.
