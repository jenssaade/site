# Types of Platforms

The **Platform Specification** is designed to address the diverse needs of modern cloud and enterprise ecosystems by providing a structured approach to defining and managing platforms. Platforms are the foundation of software delivery, and they come in various forms depending on their focus and purpose. This page defines and documents the three primary types of platforms: **Infrastructure Platforms**, **Developer Platforms**, and **Services and SaaS Control Plane Platforms**.

Each type serves a distinct role in the ecosystem, yet they are often interconnected, creating a cohesive foundation for building, deploying, and managing modern applications.

## Infrastructure Platforms

### **Definition**
Infrastructure Platforms are foundational platforms that manage compute, storage, networking, and other essential infrastructure resources. They also provide **core, shared, and centralized services** that support higher-layer platforms, such as Developer platforms and SaaS control planes. Infrastructure Platforms abstract the complexity of resource management and ensure scalability, consistency, and operational efficiency.

**Focus:** Manage and provide foundational resources and services for building cloud-native solutions.
**Target Users:** Operations teams, platform engineers, and cloud administrators.

### **Core Responsibilities**
- **Resource Provisioning and Management:**  Automate the creation and maintenance of foundational cloud resources, including compute, storage, and network services.

- **Policy Enforcement and Governance:**  Enforce security, compliance, and operational policies across environments to maintain consistency and control.
- **Networking Configuration and Connectivity:**  Establish and manage robust networking infrastructure to support intra- and inter-cluster communication, as well as external connectivity.
- **Monitoring and Observability:**  Provide tools and integrations for tracking the health, performance, usage, and cost of infrastructure components.
- **Centralized Access and Visibility:** Offer a unified dashboard to visualize infrastructure resources, environments, and their configurations, ensuring accessibility and security.
- **Identity Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement secure authentication mechanisms for platform access and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.

### **Core Services**

   - Secure ingress/egress controls through firewalls and security groups.
   - Service Meshes and Multi-Cluster Routing.
   - VPN Access for internal end-users (Developers, Operators, Administrators).

### **Shared Services**
1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Identity management through IAM or centralized identity providers.
   - Secure key and certificate management.

2. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Aggregated logs, infrastructure monitoring tools, and visual dashboards.
   - Alerts for anomalies or policy violations.

3. **Cost Management**:
   - Budget tracking, usage reporting, and resource tagging.

### **Centralized Services**
1. **Self-Service Portals**:
   - Interfaces for provisioning resources and monitoring infrastructure.

2. **Policy Enforcement**:

3. **Integration Hubs**:
   - Connections to CI/CD pipelines, developer tools, and external services.

### **Use Cases**
- Hosting workloads for application platforms and business applications.
- Supporting multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud environments.
- Providing the foundational layer for all other platform types.

## Developer Platforms

### **Definition**
Developer Platforms are designed to empower developers by simplifying the application lifecycle. They provide tools, services, and workflows that abstract infrastructure complexity, enabling developers to focus on building and delivering business-critical applications.

- **Testing Automation:**  Integrate automated testing frameworks for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Self-Service and Resource Accessibility:**  Empower developers to request, configure, and manage resources via self-service interfaces and reusable component catalogs.
- **Developer Portals and Service Catalogs:**  Provide centralized portals for developers to access resources, APIs, and documentation, along with a curated service catalog for standard components.
- **Application-Centric Observability:**  Equip developers with tools for application performance monitoring, debugging, and tracing, ensuring quality and reliability.
- **Standardization and Best Practices:**  Establish and enforce consistent practices for application development, security, and deployment across teams and projects.
- **Collaboration Support:**  Enable seamless collaboration and version control through integration with CI/CD systems, Git workflows, and shared resources.
