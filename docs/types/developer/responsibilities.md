# Developer Platform Responsibilities

## **Core Responsibilities**

- **Developer Enablement:**  Provide pre-configured development environments, tools, and services that accelerate software creation and deployment.
- **Streamlining Application and API Services:**  Deliver managed application-level services, such as serverless computing, API gateways, and databases, to reduce complexity for developers.
- **Testing Automation:**  Integrate automated testing frameworks for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Self-Service and Resource Accessibility:**  Empower developers to request, configure, and manage resources via self-service interfaces and reusable component catalogs.
- **Developer Portals and Service Catalogs:**  Provide centralized portals for developers to access resources, APIs, and documentation, along with a curated service catalog for standard components.
- **Application-Centric Observability:**  Equip developers with tools for application performance monitoring, debugging, and tracing, ensuring quality and reliability.
- **Standardization and Best Practices:**  Establish and enforce consistent practices for application development, security, and deployment across teams and projects.
- **Collaboration Support:**  Enable seamless collaboration and version control through integration with CI/CD systems, Git workflows, and shared resources.

## **Core Services**
