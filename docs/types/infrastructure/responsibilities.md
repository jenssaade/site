# Infrastructure Platform Responsibilities

## **Core Responsibilities**
- **Resource Provisioning and Management:**  Automate the creation and maintenance of foundational cloud resources, including compute, storage, and network services.
- **Platform Orchestration:**  Oversee the deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management (scaling, upgrades, failovers) of Kubernetes clusters and other orchestration systems.
- **Policy Enforcement and Governance:**  Enforce security, compliance, and operational policies across environments to maintain consistency and control.
- **Networking Configuration and Connectivity:**  Establish and manage robust networking infrastructure to support intra- and inter-cluster communication, as well as external connectivity.
- **Monitoring and Observability:**  Provide tools and integrations for tracking the health, performance, usage, and cost of infrastructure components.
- **Centralized Access and Visibility:** Offer a unified dashboard to visualize infrastructure resources, environments, and their configurations, ensuring accessibility and security.
- **Identity Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement secure authentication mechanisms for platform access and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.

## **Core Services**
1. **Compute**:
   - Provision VMs, containers, and orchestration systems like Kubernetes.
   - Autoscaling based on predefined policies or demand.

2. **Storage**:
   - Object storage for unstructured data, block storage for workloads, and file systems for shared access.
   - Data replication, lifecycle management, and disaster recovery.

3. **Networking**:
   - Virtual networks (e.g., VPCs), load balancers, and DNS management.
   - Secure ingress/egress controls through firewalls and security groups.
   - Service Meshes and Multi-Cluster Routing.
   - VPN Access for internal end-users (Developers, Operators, Administrators).

## **Shared Services**
1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Identity management through IAM or centralized identity providers.
   - Secure key and certificate management.

2. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Aggregated logs, infrastructure monitoring tools, and visual dashboards.
   - Alerts for anomalies or policy violations.

3. **Cost Management**:
   - Budget tracking, usage reporting, and resource tagging.

## **Centralized Services**
1. **Self-Service Portals**:
   - Interfaces for provisioning resources and monitoring infrastructure.

2. **Policy Enforcement**:
   - Automated application of security, compliance, and cost policies.

3. **Integration Hubs**:
   - Connections to CI/CD pipelines, developer tools, and external services.
