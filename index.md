The Platform Specification understands that cloud native platforms come in many shapes and sizesâ€”from <strong>Infrastructure Platforms</strong> to <strong>Developer Platforms</strong>, <strong>Services Platforms</strong>, and beyond.  Rather than trying to dictate a one-size-fits-all solution, Platform Spec provides a flexible framework for defining and implementing any type of platform. By recognizing the commonalities across these diverse platforms, Platform Spec leverages a modular and composable approach. This means you can reuse overlapping aspects across different platform types, streamlining the definition and description of your intended platform outcome, regardless of its specific focus. Whether you're building an Infrastructure-as-Code powerhouse or a streamlined Developer Experience, Platform Spec empowers you to build better platforms faster by focusing on what truly matters: your unique requirements and innovation.
